Express is minimal node js framework, a higher level of abstraction.

Express cotnain a very robust set of features- 
1. Complex Routing
2. Handling of request and response
3. Middleware
4. Server-side rendering

Dont have to reinvent the wheel.

// Express makes it easier to organise our application into MVC architecture.
