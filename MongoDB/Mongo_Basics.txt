This covers basics of mongoDB, as most of the basics are done in command line hence I will be writing down some of the basics here.

In terminal start the mongo server by using command mongod.
Create another terminal window, type mongosh top open Mongo Shell.

// CRUD Opeations 

1. Creating database

Type the following to create a database in Mongo Shell

use databaseName

Creating Collection

collection contains database, that means collection is a set of data

2. Reading data

As the collection is ready, start adding data by using

db.tours.insertOne({data in JSON});

if multiple use 

db.tours.insertMany({data 1}, {data 2})

# To display data

db.tours.find() // Displays all the data present in the collection tours
