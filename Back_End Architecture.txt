#Backend Architecture 

The MVC Architecture, or Model-View-Controller, is a design pattern that lets you separate the presentation of data from the business logic.

#MVC Architecture

The goal of the architecture is to spilt a big application into specific sections which have their own purpose.

The three main sections are:
1. Controller
2. Model
3. View

-> The Controller handles request flow, and never worries about data flow (or database).
-> The Model handles data flow, and never worries about request flow.
-> The View handles data presentation, and send dynamically rendered presentation(HTML) to controller.

Now the important thing is when user requests data, the request is sent to the controller, 
And then the controller then interacts with model, model then requests data from the database.
Then model sends the data to controller, which then send the response to the view, which renders the HTML
And sends the rendered presentation to the controller, which then sends the response to the user.

## IMP: In this architecture, the model and the view never interacts with each other.
